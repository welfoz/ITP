    - create struct targetBullet 
         x de t 
         y de t 
         random speed
         targetBullet_isexplosion
         
    - draw()
    - move()
        
TASK 4 : 
    The cannon, bullets and targets should have a more visually attractive shape - an example of how to draw a trapezoid at any angle can be found in 08-tapered_bullet git repository.
- cannon -> in progress

On the screen, we can find more than one enemy. Additional ones should appear in random time stamps and should have different movement path. 
Add score table in a corner of the screen. The table should show the number of hit enemies and the number of fired bullets.
