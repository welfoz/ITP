
DUE TO THE 9th JUNE 

dynamic for ennemies => need to know how this works

Modify the program from task 5 in such a way that after shooting down all the enemy ships, there is a transition to the next level, where there are more ships moving faster and firing more often. Use dynamic memory allocation.

NEED TO MALLOC 



multiple bullets for ships ?  => non ? 

- plus value => permet de ne pas faire de nouvelles 
- malloc = allocation dynamique
